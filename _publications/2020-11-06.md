title: "On the translates of general dyadic systems on R"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2020-11-06
excerpt: 'Many techniques in harmonic analysis use the fact that a continuous object can be written as a sum (or an intersection) of dyadic counterparts, as long as those counterparts belong to an adjacent dyadic system. Here we generalize the notion of adjacent dyadic system and explore when it occurs, leading to some new and perhaps surprising classifications. In particular, we show that every dyadic grid is determined by two parameters, the \emph{shift} and the \emph{location}; moreover two dyadic grids form an adjacent dyadic system if and only if their shifts and locations satisfy readily verifiable conditions.'
