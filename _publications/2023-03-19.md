title: "Skeleton Regression: A Graph-Based Approach to Estimation with Manifold Structure"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2023-03-19
excerpt: 'We introduce a new regression framework designed to deal with large-scale, complex data that lies around a low-dimensional manifold. Our approach first constructs a graph representation, referred to as the skeleton, to capture the underlying geometric structure. We then define metrics on the skeleton graph and apply nonparametric regression techniques, along with feature transformations based on the graph, to estimate the regression function. In addition to the included nonparametric methods, we also discuss the limitations of some nonparametric regressors with respect to the general metric space such as the skeleton graph. The proposed regression framework allows us to bypass the curse of dimensionality and provides additional advantages that it can handle the union of multiple manifolds and is robust to additive noise and noisy observations. We provide statistical guarantees for the proposed method and demonstrate its effectiveness through simulations and real data examples.'
