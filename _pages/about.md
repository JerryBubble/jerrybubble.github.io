My name is Zeyu Wei but feel free to call me Jerry. I am currently a Ph.D. student in the Department of Statistics at the University of Washington. 

I obtained my BS degree from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, majoring in Statistics, Mathematics, and Sociology, with a certificate in Computer Science. Thankfully, I had the opportunity to work on a project about Autoregressive Conditional Fr\'echet Model under the supervision of Professor [Zhengjun Zhang](http://pages.stat.wisc.edu/~zjz/). My four years at UW-Madison are wonderful, with so many things learned in such a beautiful little city.

After joining the University of Washington Stats department,  I developed my interest in the topological features of data with the [Geometric Data Analysis Reading Group](https://uwgeometry.github.io/) and now is an organizer of this reading group. I'm currently working with my advisor Professor [Yen-Chi Chen](http://faculty.washington.edu/yenchic/) on a series of projects focusing on representing manifold structure with graphs and use such graphs to assist data analysis tasks such as clustering and regression. Please check out the [R package](https://github.com/JerryBubble/skeletonMethods) and some associated [animations](https://cse512-22sp.pages.cs.washington.edu/SkeletonVis/).

I am also working on a project with my other advisor Professor [Tyler McCormick](https://thmccormick.github.io/) along with Professor [Arun Chandrasekhar](https://economics.stanford.edu/people/arun-g-chandrasekhar) (Stanford Econ) and [Paul Goldsmith-Pinkham](https://som.yale.edu/faculty/paul-goldsmith-pinkham) (Yale) on assessing the performance of epidemic models under missingness in the network. 

In my spare time, I enjoy all sorts of sports such as badminton, sailing, hiking, soccer, and boxing. I am a fan of souls-like games.
